        <h2>Survey Report of Rainwater Harvesting Model In Malaysia:</h2>
        <p>Implementation of Rainwater Harvesting in Malaysia
            In Malaysia, rainwater harvesting system was officially introduced after the 1998
            drought by MHLG. The 1999 ‘Guidelines for Installing a Rainwater Collection and
            Utilization System’ can be seen as the initial phase of the rainwater harvesting policy in
            Malaysia. The main purpose of these guidelines is to reduce the dependence on treated
            water and provides a convenient buffer in times of emergency or a shortfall in the water
            supply. It also proposed the construction of ‘mini dams’ or rainwater tanks in urban area
            instead of continuing to build giant dams upstream (Mohd.-Shawahid et al., 2007). This
            guidelines is intended as an ‘ideal manual’ for reference for those who want to install a
            rainwater harvesting and utilization system (MHLG, 2008)
            After five years of this guidelines, namely in 2004, the MHLG has prepared
            another cabinet paper to the National Water Resources Council to encourage government
            buildings to install a rainwater collection and utilization system. The Council has later
            announced that rainwater utilization is to be encouraged, but not mandatory. The
            Department of Irrigation and Drainage and The Ministry of Energy, Water and
            Communication (KTAK) (now is known as Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and
            Water (KTTHA); due to the restructuring of cabinet as announced by the Prime Minister
            of Malaysia on April, 9 2009) are the other two government agencies that implement the
            rainwater harvesting system in the early. The acceptance on rainwater harvesting system
            in the beginning is not good enough. Only few areas like Sandakan and Shah Alam that
            has introduced rainwater harvesting system in new housing developments (Mohd.-
            Shawahid et al., 2007).
            National Hydraulic Research Institute of Malaysia (NAHRIM) that established
            under Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment in 2004 is also one of the agencies
            that carried out pilot projects for rainwater harvesting system. The projects are (i) double
            storey terrace house located at Taman Wangsa Melawati, Kuala Lumpur, (ii) Taman
            Bukit Indah Mosque, Ampang and (iii) Headquarters of the Department of Irrigation and
            Drainage, Kuala Lumpur (Jamaluddin and Huang, 2007). In support of the government’s
            interest in RWH, NAHRIM also actively involved in designing and installing rainwater
            harvesting system for several schools (Mohd.-Shawahid et al., 2007).
            In 2005, the Federal Constitution has been transferred all matters related to water
            supply services from State List to Concurrent List (Mohd.-Shawahid, et. al. 2007). This
            enable the Federal Government involvement in the water services sector and to establish
            regulated water services industry. Due to this, KTTHA has come up with two new water
            related laws; Water Services Industry Act 2006 and Water Services Commission Act
            2006. In the new act, the Ministry is actively involved in the water saving programs
            which encouraging rainwater harvesting system implementation. Figure 1 showing the
            development of rainwater harvesting implementation development in Malaysia since
            1975 until present.</p>

            <img src="research report.JPG" id="img2" alt="!!Survey Report of RWH Model In malaysia!!"/>
            <br>
            <p>This report discussed about the respondents’ perceptions towards RWH system. It
                gives insight in the move of RWH in Malaysia. Various government agencies are actively
                involved in promoting rainwater harvesting system. In ensuring its success, the
                respondents’ perception has to be gauged as to give some feedback to the government
                and the implementer. The key point from this study is there is a positive move in the
                implementation of RWH i.e. almost 60 to 65% of the respondents interested in
                implementing RWH and willing to install the rainwater tank. On the implementation
                issue, the benefits of RWH has to be widely publicised, perhaps by using mass media as
                to promote the RWH to public at large. With the strong move by construction industry
                professional via Green Building Index (GBI), we can expect the active implementation of
                RWH in the near future <a href="Rainwater_Harvesting_Evaluation_A_Quick.pdf" target="_blank">more..</a></p>
