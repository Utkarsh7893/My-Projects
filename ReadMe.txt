Project Overview
This project represents one of my earliest attempts at building a functional and visually structured website during my 1st semesterof engineering. At that time, I was still exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the fundamentals of front-end development, so this project served as a practical playground where I could experiment, make mistakes, and learn by doing. While it may not be perfect or highly optimized, it holds value as a marker of my growth and the beginning of my web development journey. The website features a simple user interface with basic layout, styling, and navigation between sections. I focused on assembling visual components, working with images, applying CSS background designs, and ensuring the content displayed in a clean and understandable format. Looking back, I can clearly see opportunities for improvement in responsiveness, design consistency, and code structure — and I am actively refining these areas as I continue to improve the project.

Beyond aesthetic changes, my intention with editing this project now is not just to make it look more modern, but also to demonstrate how my understanding of development has evolved over time. I want this repository to reflect both where I started and the progress I’ve made since then. It’s part of my personal portfolio restructuring, where I’m curating past work with more polish and context.
Going forward, I aim to further expand my skill set and ultimately become a full-stack web developer someone equally comfortable with UI design, browser behavior, backend logic, and database management. This project is an early example of that path, and I hope anyone reading this gets a glimpse of the passion and curiosity that fuel my learning.
